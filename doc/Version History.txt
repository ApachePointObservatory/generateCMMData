2.4.0 2013-05-21
- Reduced number of iterations to speed up file generation.
- The distance computation for ordering points is now based on max(dx, dy), instead of Euclidean distance.
  This is a better approximation of the true cost, though in practice it is unlikely to matter much.
- Moved most example code to the examples directory (much of it was broken due to the use of relative imports).
